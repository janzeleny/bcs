BCS - Block Clustering Segmentation
===================================

(c) Jan Zelený 2017

This is a reference implementation of the BLock Clustering Segmentation algorithm for web page segmentation.

It uses the experimental [CSSBox rendering engine](https://github.com/radkovo/CSSBox) for rendering the web pages. Please note that CSSBox only supports a limited set of CSS3 and no JavaScript. Therefore, some modern real-world
web pages may not be rendered correctly.

When using BCS for your scientific work, please cite the following paper:
